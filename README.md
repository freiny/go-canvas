# go-window

A multi-platform library for easy access to window and input in Go/Golang

## Installation

* On OS X, you need Xcode or Command Line Tools for Xcode (`xcode-select --install`) for required headers and libraries.

* On Ubuntu/Debian-like Linux distributions, you need `libgl1-mesa-dev` and `xorg-dev` packages.

* See [here](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html#compile_deps) for full details.

* Go 1.4+ is required on Windows (otherwise you must use MinGW v4.8.1 exactly, see [Go issue 8811](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/8811)).
